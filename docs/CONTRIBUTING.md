# Contributing

When contributing to this project, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this
repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your
interactions with the project.

OnDemand is made up of multiple components and libraries with their own repos.
An index of all the repos can be found on the [README.md](README.md).

## Pull Request Process

1. [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the component or library you want to modify.
2. Branch off of the master branch (see exceptions below) and apply fix.
3. Create a PR to merge into the master upstream branch.
4. We will review it and either add comments for requested changes or merge.

### Exceptions

1. When making proposed changes to the [Open OnDemand website](https://osc.github.io/Open-OnDemand/), please branch off of the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/OSC/Open-OnDemand/tree/gh-pages).
2. When making proposed changes to the [Open OnDemand documentation](https://github.com/OSC/ood-documentation), please branch off of the develop branch (this is the default branch on the repo).

### Tips

1. Contributions accompanied by unit tests are recommended.
2. For Ruby code we add [yardoc](https://yardoc.org/) comments above all of our public interface methods as this is used to generate helpful documentation on http://www.rubydoc.info/. We do not yet have adopted a strong style guide for code in JavaScript and Python.
3. With the PR for the change, add to the CHANGELOG a line under the "Unreleased" section specifying https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/.
4. Follow best conventions with Ruby coding style. We haven't yet adopted a strict style guide, so unless you are using tabs or 4 spaces instead of 2 spaces you will probably not find an objection from us.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a
project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of
specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
