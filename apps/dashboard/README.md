# Open OnDemand Dashboard

This app is a Rails app for Open OnDemand that serves as a gateway to launching
other Open OnDemand apps. Like all Open OnDemand apps, it's meant to runs as a non-root
user.

This is a guide to developing the dashboard.

This documentation assumes you have [development enabled](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/app-development/enabling-development-mode.html)
for yourself.  Containers built in [the development documentation](../../DEVELOPMENT.md)
have development enabled automatically.

## Getting started

First, you'll need to clone this repo and make a symlink.

```text
mkdir -p ~/ondemand/dev
git clone https://github.com/OSC/ondemand.git ~/ondemand/src
cd ~/ondemand/dev
ln -s ../src/apps/dashboard
```

Open OnDemand sees all of the apps in `~/ondemand/dev` and the
dashboard is just like any other!

## Building

Prerequisites to building are ruby 2.5 and nodejs 12.  You'll also need gcc
and g++ to build gems and node packages.  Getting these available on your systems
is left to the reader.

They are available on the webnode based off of RPM/deb package dependencies.
However, you may choose to have a different development runtime, and that's fine.
OSC maintainers use `modules` on compute nodes instead of developing on the webnodes
themselves.

It should be noted here that any Ruby module installation needs configured with
`--enable-shared` flag to be compatible with the Ruby running on the webnode.

Now run `bin/setup` from within this directory to fetch all the dependencies
and compile.

```
# advanced users may not need to configure bundle. Container users must do this.
bin/bundle config path --local vendor/bundle

bin/setup
```

Now you should be able to navigate to `/pun/dev/dashboard` and see the app
in the developer views.

### Re-compiling Javascript

Since we migrated to `esbuild` assets are no longer built automatically. If you are
editing any css, javascript or images during development, you may find the
helper script `bin/recompile_js` useful to run the asset pipeline for your changes
to become available to the app.

## Customizing

Now you can refer to the [documentation on customizing](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/customization.html)
and make those changes to a `.env.local` file in the same directory as
this README.md.

Refer to [the configuration class](config/configuration_singleton.rb) to see every option
available.

Here's the user Annie Oakley's `.env.local` file to get you started.
