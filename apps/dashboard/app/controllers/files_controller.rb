    # but there is no clear solution that also enables using SAME URI INTERFACE for both directories and files
    # which is what a file system does with file system paths
    #
    # solution could be to use different URLs, one to get different representations of a single inode
    # (i.e. SHOW the file or directory)
    # and the other to get the inode children and other information (i.e. INDEX for the directory)
    #
    # files/index/(/*dirpath)
    # files/show/(/*filepath)
    #
    # the issue is "goto" where you place in the path to a file instead of a directory
    # the solution is files/index/(/*dirpath) could show the parent directory (and highlight the file)
    # or redirect the user to the parent directory (and highlight the file)
    #
    # another problem here is when we do a listing and want to generate a URL for
    # EACH file (a directory OR a file) => here we have to do control flow (if directory, link to index,
    # if file, link to file)
    #
    # but we do have control flow client side - to determine what to do with a directory or a file
    # so this would shift that to the server side (or have it serverside and client side)
