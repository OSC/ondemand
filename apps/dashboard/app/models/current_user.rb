# The CurrentUser class represents the current user on the system from Etc.
# It has a name, a home directory, gid, uid and so on.
#
# It is a singleton for the simple reason that this is ran in a single
# user context (i.e., the Per User Nginx).  And for convienence to do stuff
# like User.home instead of User.new.home or OodSupport::User.new.home.
