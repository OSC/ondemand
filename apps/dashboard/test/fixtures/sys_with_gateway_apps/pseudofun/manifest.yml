name: PseudoFuN
description: |-
  PseudoFuN is a computational tool for studying potential functions of
  pseudogenes in the context of evolution and diseases, developed by the
  Zhang Lab of Computational Genomics and Proteomics at OSU BMI.
  PseudoFuN is made of (1) a comprehensive similarity network of known pseudogenes
  and genes, (2) GO functional annotations of the nodes, (3) as well a sequence
  query tool that allows the querying of sequences (e.g. novel pseudogene
  sequence) against the network database.
