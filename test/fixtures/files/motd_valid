--- UPDATE ON GPFS SOFTWARE ISSUES
We are experiencing periodic hangs of the GPFS client file system software
used with the new storage environment. We have an open support case with
the vendor, but no solution at this time. This may affect access to the
/fs/project, and /fs/scratch file systems. Reports of transfer failures
to these file systems through scp.osc.edu, and sftp.osc.edu
have been reported.  If you experience any issues with these file systems,
please contact us at oschelp@osc.edu.
