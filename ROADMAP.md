The [entire project board](https://github.com/orgs/OSC/projects/14)
is a very high level view of the project as a whole.

## Next Release

Check the [project milestones](https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/milestones)
for every single issue related to a specific release.

## Feature Requests

No feature request is too big or too small!  Feel free to create an issue 
ticket or comment on an open issue telling us what you'd like.

You can also add a thumbs up or thumbs down reaction to an issue.  We'll try to
use the number of positive or negative reactions to prioritize features.

We use labels to identify areas and components. For example if you're insterested in
batch connect component [search the issues](https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/issues)
with the `component/batch_connect` label.  

If you're interested in any large feature not already in a project, try looking at 
[epic tickets](https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aepic).
