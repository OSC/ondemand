## Open OnDemand Demo

This is a demonstration container for the Open OnDemand
platform.

### Applications

#### Terminals over the web.

The **Shell** application is available to use. In this demonstration
container, it simply logs into the container itself. In a real
production environment this would shell into your clusters' login
nodes if enabled.

You can find this application in the Clusters menu.

#### Jupyter

This container has a **Jupyter** application built into it.
Simply launch form the 'Interactive Sessions' menu or
